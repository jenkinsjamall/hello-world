# hello-world
This is a test to see how quickly i can learn and adapt.
I am a Senior undergraduate student at Georgia State University studying to receive my B.B.A in Computer Information Systems.
I am excited to graduate this year and I am looking forward to seeing what is in store for me after college.
For no, I will work to increase my knowledge of different topics within the IT field.
